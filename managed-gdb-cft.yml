Description: Creates supporting resources for automated global database endpoint management solution.

######################################################################################################################
# Changelog:
# 8/29/2021 : ausamant - added managed policies for the lambda role instead of inline policies
#                      - added stackid as a uniquifier for managed policy names
# 4/23/2022 : ausamant - added ability to choose either planned or unplanned feature support
